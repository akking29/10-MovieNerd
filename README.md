"# 10-MovieNerd" 

Version 1.0!

Search is working! 

Known issues: 

1. When clicking "New Search" on the "details" page it clears the search results that it obtained the details from, rather than leaving it populated and allowing to modify the current search.

2. The details page looks stupid. 

3. The result boxes that are populated from search can get a bit janky depending on the length of the movie title.
